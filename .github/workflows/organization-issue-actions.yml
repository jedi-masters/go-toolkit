            Hello, I'm a bot and I thank you in the name of the community for opening this issue.

            To help our human contributors focus on the most relevant reports, I check up on old issues to see if they're still relevant.
            This issue has had no activity for 90 days, and so I marked it as stale.

            The community would appreciate your effort in checking if the issue is still valid. If it isn't, please close it.
            If the issue persists, and you'd like to remove the stale label, you simply need to leave a comment. Your comment can be as simple as "still important to me". 
            If no comment left within 21 days this issue will be closed.
          close-issue-message: |
            I'll close this issue, but if you need more info/help just let us know by opening a new issue!
